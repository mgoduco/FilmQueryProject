# FilmQueryProject

This application pulls data from an SQL database and presents the user with a menu in which they can choose to look up a film by its id and or search query. If the user chooses to look up a film by its id they are prompted to enter the id and if the film is found, its title, year, rating, and description are displayed. If the user chooses to looks up a film by search keyword, they are prompted to enter it. If no matching films are found, they see a message saying so. Otherwise, they see a list of films for which the search term was found anywhere in the title or description when a film is displayed, its language (English,Japanese, etc.) is also displayed and finally the list of actors in its cast are displayed. The user can repeatedly query by id or search word until they decide to exit the application.
